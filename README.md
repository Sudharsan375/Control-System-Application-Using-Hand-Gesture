CONTROL SYSTEM APPLICATION USING HAND GESTURE : The project utilizes computer vision and deep learning to develop a hand gesture-based control system, enabling users to interact with the system without external devices like keyboards or mice. My role involves developing and training the algorithm to enhance the model's accuracy. By employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV, we aim to improve user interaction and the overall responsiveness of the system. This approach not only streamlines user experience but also opens up new possibilities for accessibility in technology. For more details, you can refer to our findings published in the journal  http://www.ijrar.org/papers/IJRA
